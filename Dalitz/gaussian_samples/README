This folder is for generating 2 dimensional Gaussian data.
The file generate_gaussian_samples.py generates a single file
and takes the input (number of data points) (x mean) (x standard 
deviation) (y mean) (y standard deviation) (label of file)
The label of the file is an integer that enables us to have 
multiple files generated from the same gaussians. 
It is run as follows:

./generate_gaussian_samples.py 10000 0.5 0.1 0.5 0.1 1

or

python generate_gaussian_samples.py 10000 0.5 0.1 0.5 0.1 1

The automate_generate_gaussian_samples.py file is a python
bash script to generate many files. The input parameters of the
Gaussians are specified within the file. It is run as follows:

./automate_generate_gaussian_samples.py

or 

python automate_generate_gaussian_samples.py

The output of these programs are text files with two columns 
containing the x and y data points. These files are stored in 
the gauss_data subfolder.
