This part of the project focussed on CP violation in Dalitz plots. 
Samples are either taken from the gaussian_samples directory for
2 or higher dimensional gaussian distributions or from dpmodel
for a more sophisticated Dalitz plot model. 
One should take two data files to compare and call them data.+.txt
and data.cpv.v2.txt for example and then run

python goodness_of_fit.py

This will produce he following files:
data_unshuffled.txt
data.txt
different Machine_learning_predictions pdfs
