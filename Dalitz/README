# Author:   Constantin Weisser (weisser@mit.edu)
#
# Purpose:  In this directory the Goodness of fit project is stored. 
#	    Data from gaussian_samples, Dalitz plots (dpmodel) and
#	    possibly LIGO will be created, then analyses and the
#	    p value distributions plotted

This part of the project focussed on CP violation in Dalitz plots. 
Samples are either taken from the gaussian_samples directory for
2 or higher dimensional gaussian distributions or from dpmodel
for a more sophisticated Dalitz plot model. 
One should take two data files to compare and call them data.+.txt
and data.cpv.v2.txt for example and then go to the corresponding 
automation_scripts directory (e.g. automation_scripts/dp) and run

python automate_goodness_of_fit.py

This will produce he following files:
data_unshuffled.txt
data.txt
different Machine_learning_predictions pdfs

The definition of the machine learning algorithms is done in
classifier_eval.py

The folder two_sample_tests contains a version of the Cramer van Mises
test I have adapted from R code and the ks_2samp test implemented in 
python.

If you want to change which classifier to use you have to uncomment
the classifier you want by hand in goodness_of_fit.py

The results of the analysis are stored in Dalitz/graphs and 
Dalitz/test_statistic_distributions
