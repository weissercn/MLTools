This script can be used to get the p value for classifiers. It takes input files with column vectors corresponding to features and lables. 
Then there are two different routes one can go down. When mode has a value of 1, then a grid search will be performed on 
one set of input files. If it is 2, then the hyperparemeter search is performed by spearmint. When the mode is turned off (0), 
then the p value is computed for multiple sets of input files and the p value distribution is plotted.
