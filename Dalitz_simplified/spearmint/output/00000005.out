Problem executing the function

This script can be used to get the p value for classifiers. It takes input files with column vectors corresponding to features and lables. 
Then there are two different routes one can go down. When optimise_hyperparam_mode is enabled (1), then a grid search will be performed on 
one set of input files. When the mode is turned off (0), then the p value is computed for multiple sets of input files and the p value 
distribution is plotted.  

Anything printed here will end up in the output directory for job #5
{u'aC': array([ 0.1]), u'agamma': array([  1.00000000e-07])}
